- Introduction
    - The idea is to build a report with students. You can begin with your short introduction, family & education background, current location, work, hobbies, etc. You can then go around & ask every student the same.
- Motivation - Why should the students learn computer programming in the first place?
    - A few of the reasons for learning computer programming are developing critical thinking, better career prospects, and empowerment. While you can cover all these things, for a high school kid these reasons could be a bit far-fetched.
    - You can approach this topic by emphasizing the *fun* side of learning computer programming. That can include creating your own website, putting up on the internet, and sharing it with your friends and family. Or maybe one day creating a mobile game that they play every day.
    - You can also point out the omnipresence of computers and programming. Be it a mobile phone or a refrigerator. From WhatsApp to self-driving cars to rockets.
    - In the end, you can also touch base on how computer programming can lead to better career prospects by giving your own example.
- Basics of HTML & building blocks of a website.
    - What is HTML?
        - HTML (**H**yper**t**extÂ **M**arkupÂ **L**anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, letâ€™s check [Sachin Tendulkarâ€™s wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar). Over here as you can see, content is structured within a set of paragraphs, lists, images bulleted points, tables, etc.
        - What is an HTML element?
            - Here you can share your screen and use [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default_default) interface to explain further.
            - The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
            - `<h1> Coding4All is fantastic! ðŸ™‚Â </h1>` â€” This is an example of an HTML content.
                - `<h1>` is the opening tag. `</h1>` is the closing tag. And `Coding4All is fantastic! ðŸ™‚`Â  is the content.
            - Show & edit various tags like body, head, paragraph, image, etc in W3School sandbox.
