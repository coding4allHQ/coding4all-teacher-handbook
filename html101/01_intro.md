# Key goals for the class

As this is the introductory class, we should begin by building a rapport with the students, and establish trust and familiarity. Next, given the diverse backgrounds the students may be coming from, we should try to bring everyone to a common (basline) understanding of web technologies (how internet works, how webapps work, what is HTML, etc) and how they work.

# Suggested activities

* Activity 1: Introduce yourself
    - A round of introductions, starting with the teacher
    - The teacher should ideally note the students' interests and hobbies so that later they can prompt them when choosing ideas for webpages
* Activity 2: Discuss why should we bother learning to write code?
    - A round-table discussion on why the students want to learn coding
    - The teacher can emphasize:
      - Computers are everywhere, from whatsapp tomobile phones to self-driving cars to rockets.
      - Coding can develop critical thinking, improve career prospects, and empower the students build and ship independently.
      - Coding can also be fun. Not in the distant future, right now. You can create your own website (before the course is done), put it up on the internet, and share it with your friends and family.
* Activity 3: Try to come up with a program for a common activity (for example: making nimbu paani or baking a cake)

**Notes**

* The teacher should talk about his own experience as much as possible. What they like about coding. How coding helps with the job they are doing right now. Their journey.
* The teacher should emphasize that doing this course is not about becoming a coder. Not everyone has to become a programmer. This course is about finding out if the students like coding by building something real and empower them for the journey beyond if they like it.

# Learning outcomes

By the end of the sessions, the student should ideally have a good understanding of the following topics. We also mention a few helpful pointers and resources.

* How the web works
* What is a website?
  - The server-client model (talking about ports is optional)
  - Websites are pages served by the server when contacted by a client
* What is HTML and how it is used?
  - HTML (**H**yper**t**extÂ **M**arkupÂ **L**anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, letâ€™s check [Sachin Tendulkarâ€™s wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar). Over here as you can see, content is structured within a set of paragraphs, lists, images bulleted points, tables, etc.
* What is an HTML element?
  - The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
  - Here you can share your screen and use [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default_default) interface to explain further.
  - `<h1> Coding4All is fantastic! ðŸ™‚Â </h1>` â€” This is an example of an HTML content.
    - `<h1>` is the opening tag. `</h1>` is the closing tag. And `Coding4All is fantastic! ðŸ™‚`Â  is the content.
    - Show & edit various tags like body, head, paragraph, image, etc in [W3School sandbox](). (**put the link to sandbox here**)

# Assignments

* Watch a video on how the web works ([suggested video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJHvdBlSxug))
* **PENDING** create an example page for students to analyse (HTML sandbox demonstrations)

# How to revise

We recommend revising this session at the start of the next session. Here we recommend questions and activities that you can use when revising with students.

* Ask questions (correcting or expanding on students' response is not necessary unless they reveal a conceptual misunderstanding)
   - What is the internet?
   - What is a website?
   - What is HTML?
   - What is an HTML tag?
