# Key goals for the class

In this class, we introduce the students to an Integrated Development Environment and teach them to work with it. We'll also make use of in-built integration with github so that the students don't have to learn about git and git workflows.

# Suggested activities

* Activity 1: Installing an IDE
  - Brief discussion around word editors and IDE? Doing some comparisons and contrasts will be helpful.
    - Note: students may not have used a word editor before.
  - Download the [SPCK IDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.spck) from Google PlayStore ([here is a reference video on how to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogua-snbvjQ&t=4s&ab_channel=Coding4All))
* Activity 2: Link Github & SPCK editor via access token
* Activity 3: Work through the coding workflow
  - Clone the GitHub repo in SPCK
  - Make changes
  - Commit and push the changes to github
  - Check out the new webpage

# Learning outcomes

By the end of the sessions, the student should ideally be able to answer the following questions.

* What is an IDE?
* Give examples of the kind of things we can do with an IDE.
* Why do we need to provide the github access token in SPCK?
* What does cloning a repo mean?
* Where does the cloned repo exist, in github or in my phone where I cloned it?
* If I make changes to a file in a repo cloned in my phone, will the file change in the repo in github? Why or why not?

# Assignments

Now the students know how to make their webpages more interesting, so we ask them to repeat the exercise from the last class.

* Students can be asked to make their webpages more exciting 

# How to revise

We recommend revising this session at the start of the next session. For this class, the teacher can use the questions from the `Learning outcomes` section.

* What is an IDE?
* Give examples of the kind of things we can do with an IDE.
* Why do we need to provide the github access token in SPCK?
* What does cloning a repo mean?
* Where does the cloned repo exist, in github or in my phone where I cloned it?
* If I make changes to a file in a repo cloned in my phone, will the file change in the repo in github? Why or why not?

We recommend adding one additional question.

* Have you heard of other code editors/IDEs? Can you name one?

This kind of questions can help you identify the self-starters in your cohort. We have found that the energy of these students can be infectious, so that is something you may want to look out for.
