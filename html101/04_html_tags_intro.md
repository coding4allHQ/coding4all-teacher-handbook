# Key goals for the class
Main goal behind this class is to get comfortable with HTML Page structure using the basic content tags.

# Suggested activities
 * Activity:
    - Heading & Paragraph
        - Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc. Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.
        - In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a ```<p>``` tag:
            ```html
            <p>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.</p>
             ```
        - Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:
            ```html
            <h1>I am the title of the story.</h1>
            ```
        - There are six heading elements: ```<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>,``` and ```<h6>```.
        - Each element represents a different level of content in the document; ```<h1>``` represents the main heading, ```<h2>``` represents subheadings, ```<h3>``` represents sub-subheadings, and so on.
    - Lists
        - Lists are everywhere in lifeâ€”from your shopping list to the list of directions you subconsciously follow to get to your house every day, to the lists of instructions you are following in these tutorials! Lists are everywhere on the web, too, and we've got three different types to worry about.
        - Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of the items doesn't matter. Let's take a shopping list as an example:
        ```html
        <ul>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>maggi</li>
            <li>bread</li>
            <li>butter</li>
        </ul>
        ```
        - Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter. Let's take a set of directions as an example:
        ```html
        <ol>
            <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
            <li>Turn right</li>
            <li>Go straight till you see a temple</li>
            <li>Turn left from the temple</li>
            <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
        </ol>
        ```
    - Links(href)
        - What is a URL?
            - A URL can point to HTML files, text files, images, text documents, video and audio files, or anything else that lives on the Web.
        - A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, inside an ```<a>``` element and using the href attribute, also known as a **H**ypertext **Ref**erence, or target, that contains the URL
        ```html
        <p>I'm creating a link to
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/virat.kohli/?hl=en/">Virat Kohli's Instagram page</a>.
        </p>    
        ```

**Notes**
- You can share your screen and use [w3school sandbox enviorment](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_headings) to explain the tags

# Learning outcomes
    
By the end of this class, students should have good understanding of HTML page structure. They should be able to create an HTML page using heading, paragraph, list & href tags in their phone's IDE and push the same to the GitHub.
