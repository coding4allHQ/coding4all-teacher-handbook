# Key goals for the class

In this course, we will not be using GitHub as a collaboration tool. We want students to learn by experimenting, improving, and deploying their own live app, which they can share with friends and family. GitHub Pages make that possible. So, we will just be teaching enough Git operations, that enable students to make changes and deploy the code at will.

# Suggested activities

* Activity: What is GitHub?
    - GitHub is a website that stores your code on cloud. Just like you store photos/contacts on google cloud and so that even if you change your phone, your data is restored. GitHub is just like that. You store your code on GitHub and anyone with right permission can access the code from any place.
- Creating a GitHub account from your laptop/mobile browsers.
    - You can share this video for reference [How to create a GitHub account from mobile phone browser?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=612BO484KHU&feature=youtu.be)
- Repo creation

**Notes**

- For GitHub Pages, keep the repo_name same as github_username
- Create index.html in the repo from the GitHub website itself from the browser
    - Write basic HTML code block
    
    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My first website</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello World! My name is Vivek Choksi </h1> <!-- student can write whatever they want to write. This is dummy text -->
      </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
# Learning outcomes

All students should have a basic static website live with URL `github_username.github.io` with one line of content.
