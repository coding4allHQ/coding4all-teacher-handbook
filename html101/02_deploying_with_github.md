# Key goals for the class

Teaching Git and GitHub to school kids may seem like an unncessary idea bordering on stupidity, so let's first understand what we want to do with them.

1. We'll not be teaching students about version control systems or git.
2. We'll not be using github as a version control system.
3. We'll not be using github as a tool for collaboration.
4. We'll be using github only to deploy webpages created by students to `ghpages`.

The curriculum is designed to follow a top-down approach. Students learn by deploying their first webpage as soon as possible, and then learn lower-level details (various HTML tags, CSS, etc) by constantly experimenting and deploying. That they can share their webpages with family and friends and benefit from the engagement is a nice bonus.

In this class, we simply focus on helping the students take their first webpage live. THat may not sound like an ambitious goal, but we have found from experience that this can take a bit of time and patient handholding.

# Suggested activities

* Activity 1: Discuss what is GitHub?
    - (example answer) GitHub is a website that stores your code on cloud. Just like you store photos/contacts on google cloud so that even if you change your phone, your data lives on. GitHub is just like that. You store your code on GitHub and anyone with right permission can access the code from any place.
* Activity 2: Create github account
    - You can use/share this video for reference: [How to create a GitHub account from mobile phone browser?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=612BO484KHU&feature=youtu.be)
* Activity 3: Create a repository

**Notes**

* For GitHub Pages, keep the `<repo_name>` same as `<github_username>`
* Create `index.html` in the repo from the GitHub website itself from the browser
    - Write basic HTML code block
    
    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My first website</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello World! My name is Vivek Choksi </h1> <!-- student can write whatever they want to write. This is dummy text -->
      </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
# Learning outcomes

By the end of the sessions, the student should ideally be able to answer the following questions.

* What is github? What is it useful for?
* How to sign-up for an account in github?
* What is a repository?
* How to create a repository in github?

Ideally, all students should have a basic static website live with URL `<github_username>.github.io` with one line of content.

# Assignments

* Students can be asked to make their webpages more exciting (and it's alright if they can't figure out how)

# How to revise

We recommend revising this session at the start of the next session. For this class, instead of asking any questions, the teacher can simply summarize the main learnings (what is github, why we use it, and what is a repository).
