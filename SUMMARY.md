## 📗 Class#1 **Ice breaking + Introduction to HTML**

- Introduction
    - The idea is to build a report with students. You can begin with your short introduction, family & education background, current location, work, hobbies, etc. You can then go around & ask every student the same.
- Motivation - Why should the students learn computer programming in the first place?
    - A few of the reasons for learning computer programming are developing critical thinking, better career prospects, and empowerment. While you can cover all these things, for a high school kid these reasons could be a bit far-fetched.
    - You can approach this topic by emphasizing the *fun* side of learning computer programming. That can include creating your own website, putting up on the internet, and sharing it with your friends and family. Or maybe one day creating a mobile game that they play every day.
    - You can also point out the omnipresence of computers and programming. Be it a mobile phone or a refrigerator. From WhatsApp to self-driving cars to rockets.
    - In the end, you can also touch base on how computer programming can lead to better career prospects by giving your own example.
- Basics of HTML & building blocks of a website.
    - What is HTML?
        - HTML (**H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, let’s check [Sachin Tendulkar’s wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar). Over here as you can see, content is structured within a set of paragraphs, lists, images bulleted points, tables, etc.
        - What is an HTML element?
            - Here you can share your screen and use [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default_default) interface to explain further.
            - The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
            - `<h1> Coding4All is fantastic! 🙂 </h1>` — This is an example of an HTML content.
                - `<h1>` is the opening tag. `</h1>` is the closing tag. And `Coding4All is fantastic! 🙂`  is the content.
            - Show & edit various tags like body, head, paragraph, image, etc in W3School sandbox.

**Milestone for Class#1**

<aside>
💡 Students should understand the various content types that go into a website page. Such as text, images, table, list, hyperlink, etc.

## 📗 Class#2 **Introduction to GitHub**

- In this course, we will not be using GitHub as a collaboration tool. We want students to learn by experimenting, improving, and deploying their own live app, which they can share with friends and family. GitHub Pages make that possible. So, we will just be teaching enough Git operations, that enable students to make changes and deploy the code at will.
- What is GitHub?
    - GitHub is a website that stores your code on cloud. Just like you store photos/contacts on google cloud and so that even if you change your phone, your data is restored. GitHub is just like that. You store your code on GitHub and anyone with right permission can access the code from any place.
- Creating a GitHub account from your laptop/mobile browsers.
    - You can share this video for reference [How to create a GitHub account from mobile phone browser?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=612BO484KHU&feature=youtu.be)
- Repo creation
    - For GitHub Pages, keep the repo_name same as github_username
- Create index.html in the repo from the GitHub website itself from the browser
    - Write basic HTML code block
    
    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My first website</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello World! My name is Vivek Choksi </h1> <!-- student can write whatever they want to write. This is dummy text -->
      </body>
    </html>
    ```
    

**Milestone for Class#2**

<aside>
💡 All students should have a basic static website live with URL `github_username.github.io` with one line of content.

## 📗 Class#3 Code Editor & GitHub linking

- What is a code editor? Downloading [SPCK](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.spck) code editor from Google PlayStore
    - [Reference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogua-snbvjQ&t=4s&ab_channel=Coding4All)
- Linking Github & SPCK editor via access token
